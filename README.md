# hello-world
Learning the GitHub workflow.

After coding in the corporate world for a very long time, I'm optimistic about the potential of contributing to the open source community. Maybe even starting a cool project of my own someday. Right now, though, I'm such a noob...I'd be lucky to successfully add a pull-request and get code committed. haa üòÅ
